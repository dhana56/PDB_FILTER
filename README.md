> Programing file takes the PDB files, and checks for,
>    1. Alternate locations for amino acid residues.
>    2. If the residue numbering starts with 1 or not.
>    3. Checks for the missing residue in the PDB files.
>    4. Check for the insertion residues present in the protein chains.
>    5. Checks available chains in the PDB files.
>    6. Checks for the missing atoms in the side chains of amino acid residues.

1. Run the [requirement.txt](https://github.com/dhana56/PDB_FILTER/blob/main/requirement.txt/)
in the terminal using the following command:
>       pip install requirement.txt
2. Next navigate through the folder path in which PDB_FILTER is downloaded by using "cd relative path of the PDB_FILTER "
   

3. Run the [main.py](https://github.com/dhana56/PDB_FILTER/blob/main/main.py) file using the following commnad:
   > python main.py
4. Enter the pdb id
   > eg:1mky
