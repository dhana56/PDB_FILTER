#  PDB File Filter

> Programing file takes the PDB files, and checks for,
>    1. Alternate locations for amino acid residues.
>    2. If the residue number is start with 1 or not.
>    3. Checks for the missing residue in the PDB files.
>    4. Check for the insertion residues present in the protein chains.

<p> By defult it process all the chains in the protein. For the coustomized chain, you have to enter the corresponding chain_id And it will generate processed file  only for the particular chain_id.<p>

<p>For customized chain, you have to provide the the chain id in the terminal window. Otherwise it will run for the all the chains and produce the new cleaned PDB file that contains all the chains informations.
